# GAN-MNIST
This is a simple implementation of GAN for generation of handwritten digit dataset using pytorch. For basic information about GANs implementation in PyTorch please refer to the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l6NzV4Eryo

### prerequisite
- pytorch (0.4.1) (install intructions : https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-gpu-install/blob/master/README.md)

Note : GitHub is unable to render the notebook for some unknown reason so you can copy this link(https://github.com/navidpanchi/GAN-MNIST/blob/master/Mnist_GAN.ipynb) to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and go through it there.
